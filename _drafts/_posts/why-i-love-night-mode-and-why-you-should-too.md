Alright I'll admit, before writing this article I always thought that Night Mode was just another stupid marketing gimmick. 

I mean, how the fuck is changing your display to some reddish color supposed to help you sleep better?!

But after using it on all my devices for the past 2 months or so, I can now say with confidence that I'm 100% sold.

You've probably heard of this feature before - it's called Night Light on Windows 10, Night Shift on iPhones, and blue light filter on Galaxy smartphones. 

But let's just put aside the confusing monikers for now - all it means is that your phone, tablet, or laptop's display tints itself into a warmer palette that blocks out most of the blue light radiating from your display, making it easier on your eyes in the evenings and nighttime.

"But hey", you ask me. "What _is_ blue light in the first place?"

To put it simply, computer screens and other digital devices emit significant amounts of blue light, which can reach deep into your eyes and cause damage to your retina. 

In my own use case, much of my tablet use nowadays is at night. Reading, light browsing, watching Twitch streams, consuming content of all kinds. Even with the brightness turned right the way down, it's not long before my eyes are telling me to stop.
